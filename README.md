# CS350_Project

This program, developed for a TI MCU, reads the temperature of an area using a TMP006 temperature sensor via I2C. Users can change the set temperature using buttons
via GPIO interrupt, an LED indicates when the temperature is set to increase via GPIO, and data from the thermostat is sent to the server via UART.

While this program meets the given requirements, some areas that could be improved include the implementation of the design, which includes task scheduling 
functionality. The knowledge gained from this course and applied with this project represent extremely valuable advances in my technical ability and will continue
to have value throughout my academic and professional journey in computer science.
